# Traveling-Salesman-Problem-Parallelization
Parallel Computing of the NP-hard Travelling Salesman Problem(TSP).

The travelling salesman problem (TSP): "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the origin city?" It is an NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization, important in operations research and theoretical computer science.
